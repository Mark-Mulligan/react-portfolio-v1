# Mark Mulligan

## About Me
Hey, I'm Mark and I am a web developer based in Dallas, TX. 
I first picked up coding as side hobby when I was working as a Band Director. I then began using
my new found skills to create resources for my students. My hobby soon became my passion, and I
decided to take the next step by attending the SMU Coding Bootcamp to study Full-Stack Web Development.
